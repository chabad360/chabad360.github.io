I started this blog because I need a good way to document my ideas in a way that they can be shared (plus kept together and in an organized and presentable format), and found that this is (probably) the best format.
If you think I might have something interesting to write, or find my personality (that small glimpse that you got) interesting, than you might enjoy my content.</description></item></channel></rss>
