## Concept

The concept for the *CaaB* is sort of like a Boom Box:

The boom box is powerful and portable, and so is the *CaaB*, it packs a punch for it's size, and it's fully portable.

## Design

The design of the *CaaB* is to be similar in that of a boom box, a wide rectangular box with a handle on top. It would fit a router, four ODroid HC1s, a PSU, some cables, and some special OLED Display toys (I'll cover what those are in [hardware](#hardware)). One of the sides would swing open to reveal the innards of the device, while the other would have USB, my OLED displays and other ports plus a switch or two.

## Hardware

The hardware required would be:

* 4 ODroid HC1s
* 4 [Cool OLED Things](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B076JDVRLP) (if dead [click here](http://archive.ph/ZYA8A))
* 1 280W PSU
* 1 Router
* A collection of some different kinds of cables
* A sheet of metal (to cut)

## Conclusion

That's the idea, I'll be back soon with more precise details in another article, and watch this page for updates, because it will be updated.
