## No it's not a Pi

It's an [ODroid MC1](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-mc1-my-cluster-one-with-32-cpu-cores-and-8gb-dram/), a board based on the [ODroid XU4](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-xu4-special-price/), an SBC that is multiple times more powerfull than the Pi.

## What I Got

So this is a nice table with prices of what I got, a BOM (a Bill of Materials):
