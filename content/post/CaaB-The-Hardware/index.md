## No it's not a Pi

It's an [ODroid MC1](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-mc1-my-cluster-one-with-32-cpu-cores-and-8gb-dram/), 
a board based on the [ODroid XU4](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-xu4-special-price/), 
an SBC that is multiple times more powerful than the Pi (however, I'll be using an [ODroid HC1](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-hc1-home-cloud-one/) as it has a SATA port in the back that I'll be taking advantage of).


### An ODroid What?

The ODroid XU4, which has (to quote the landing page):

> * Samsung Exynos 5422 Cortex™-A15 2Ghz and Cortex™-A7 Octa core CPUs
> * Mali-T628 MP6(OpenGL ES 3.1/2.0/1.1 and OpenCL 1.2 Full profile)
> * 2Gbyte LPDDR3 RAM PoP stacked

Now, sure there is a 2GB model of the Pi, heck, there's even a 4GB model of the Pi, but nothing the Pi has compares to an overpowered 8 core processor, plus a GPU featuring OpenGL (ES) and OpenCL support.

If you still don't think that's good enough, you can check that [landing page](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-xu4-special-price/) for some benchmarks.

## What I Got

So this is a nice table with prices of what I'm getting, a BOM (a Bill of Materials):

> Note: This is not exactly what I purchased, as some of the items I bought are bad quality or no-longer available.  
> Also, This list and all the other parts of this project will be updated over time, so stay tuned.
