Hi my name is Mendel Greenberg ([chabad360](https://github.com/chabad360)), I'm into software enginering,
DevOps, VFX (IKR), and a bunch of other random tech related things.

I started this blog because I need a good way to document my ideas in a
way that they can be shared (plus kept together and in an organized and presentable format),
and found that this is (probably) the best format.

If you think I might have something interesting to write, or find my personality (that small
glimpse that you got) interesting, than you might enjoy my content. So stick around, and hopefully
I'll have something that appeases you!

Thanks for visiting!
