Over the next little while I will be taking you on a journey as I set up my own little, private, portable, and cool ARM server cluster.
As is indicated by the title, this project will called the "Cluster as a Box" or CaaB.
This is **not a how-to guide**, this is me documenting my experience in a format that you may find informative (and hopefully you'll learn something). 
This will also act as a nice way to test my [Project](/project) format, so we'll see how it goes!
