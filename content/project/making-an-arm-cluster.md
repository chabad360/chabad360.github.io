summary: "Not a how-to guide per-se, but if you're looking to learn something, here we go!"

Over the next little while I will be going over the processes I took to setting up my own little, private ARM server cluster.
This is **not a how-to guide**, this is me documenting my experiences in a format that you find informative (maybe you'll learn something).
This will also act as a nice test to my [Project](/project) format, so we'll see how it goes!
